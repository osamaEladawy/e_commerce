## Usage

This application allows the administrator to add and manage products.
It allows users to search for any product in the categories and add it to 
their favorites list or add it to their shopping cart and choose the payment method 
between cash or Visa to purchase this product. It also allows users to add their address 
if they want the product to arrive at their location through a delivery person and 
track it on the road. It also allows users to receive notifications 
when a product is selected and set up in the store, 
the delivery person receives that product, 
and while the delivery person is on the road, 
the user finally receives their product.
